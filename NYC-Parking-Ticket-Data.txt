Title: NYC Parking Ticket Data
Theme: Urban Planning
Abstract: New York City is notorious for its lack of available parking spaces. A city that is
	known for its liveliness and fast-paced lifestyle, the city's parking spaces do not 
	seem to be keeping up with its residents needs. While some condominiums 
	provide reserved parking spaces at the price of an annual fee (around $165), most
	residents, who are also car owners and can not afford such high fees, are forced to
	park their vehicles on the streets. 
	Parking tickets in NYC can cost anywhere from $60 to $125, and I plan to show how
	parking tickets issued in New York compare to those in other states. Furthermore, 
	I also plan to show the connection between Parking Tickets issued and the lack of 
	available parking spaces in NYC. I also plan to show how lack of parking spaces 
	affect low income families. 

Relevance to NYC: All the collected data are centered around New York, and mostly focus on comparing 
		it to other states in terms of Parking tickets issued, and parking spaces available.
