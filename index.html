          New York City is notorious for its lack of available parking spaces. A
          city that is known for its liveliness and fast-paced lifestyle, the
          city's parking spaces do not seem to be keeping up with its residents
          needs. While some condominiums provide reserved parking spaces at the
          price of an annual fee (around $165), most residents, who are also car
          owners and can not afford such high fees, are forced to park their
          vehicles on the streets. With this problem on the rise, it has become
          harder to manage a vehicle, especially for those belonging to
          low-income households.

          All the collected data are centered around New York, and mostly focus
          on comparing it to other states in terms of Parking tickets issued.
          Parking tickets in NYC can cost anywhere from $60 to $125, and I plan
          to show how parking tickets issued in New York compare to those in
          other states. Furthermore, I also plan to show the connection between
          Parking Tickets issued and the lack of available parking spaces in
          NYC. I also plan to show how lack of parking spaces affect low income
          families. Using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and other methods to show

          <p>
            For 2018, we see that compared to other states, New York (the spike)
            has a very high count for total Parking Tickets Issued for that
            year, almost 800, 000. Since this was before the pandemic, let us
            consider this plot to be the control, that we compare the other
            matplots against.

            In 2019, we see that compared to 2018, New York still has a
            significantly higher rate compared to other states in terms of
            Parking Tickets issued. In this diagram, the y-axis is in terms of a
            million. So while most states are well under one million issuance of
            Parking Tickets, we see that New York alone has issued more than ten
            million Parking Tickets, in that year alone.

          <p>
            As we progress onto 2020, which was the year COVID hit, and the
            pandemic began, due to the lockdown, and social distancing laws, we
            experienced a major drop in transportation. Other than buying
            supplies and (other than front line workers), very few people had to
            go to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was also the time that many people alsogot furloughed
            while others worked, or studied from home. While this should result
            in a significant drop in Parking Tickets being issued, since the
            majority of the city's residents were then quarantined, the graph
            shows otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to last year's graph (which also uses the same scale), we
            can see that the amount of Parking Tickets Issued during the
            pandemic had still increased to more than a million. While there was
            an increase in Parking Tickets Issued in other states too, the
            amount of increment is more prominent in New York's case.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Lastly, I want to focus on the most up-to-date data on the amount of
            Parking Tickets Issued in New York as of today (12/09/2021). While
            the year is not yet over, we can see a significant spike in the
            issuance of tickets. As most in-person activities are resuming, the
            amount of transportations within the city are increasing too, thus
            contributing to more Parking Tickets being issued.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, another train of thought could be the increase in outdoor
            dining options that most restaurants now provide post-pandemic.
            While some restaurants have built-in space for outdoor dining, other
            restaurants have taken to the streets, setting up booths by the
            roadside to continue their business. But what used to be a possible
            parking space for a vehicle-owner is now space occupied by
            restaurants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from being a health, and safety hazard on its own, it can be
            argued (given the data) that roadside eating booths have
            significantly contributed towards the increase in Parking Tickets
            being issued, due to a lack of free, or affordable parking space.

            While some considerations were made during the pandemic regarding
            late payments of rent, and even decreasing the rent amount, given
            the large amount of downsizing happening at many companies, rents
            have currently spiked high.

            According to "Bloomberg Wealth", New York renters have faced up to

          Analysis
        </h3>
        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the rent prices have
            increased by $50 each year (as is standard in most rented
            condominium apartments) since 2019. Therefore, <br> these are the current
            monthly rent for the following apartments in New York City <br>
            <br />
            Studio Apartment is about $2560
            <br />
            One Bedroom Apartment is about $3160
            <br />
            And a Two Bedroom Apartment is about $3840
            <br><br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          According to the "United States Census Bureau" the annual median income of the 
          average New Yorker is $32,320. Assuming this individual rents a studio
          apartment, every year <br> they pay $30, 720 on rent. Thus, every year they are left
          with $(32,320 - 30,720) = $1600.
          <br>
          Disregarding other expenses (bills, personal expenses), this individual can only
          afford to pay at most 26 (assuming they are $60 each) or 12 (assuming they are
          $125 eacg) parking tickets in a year. 
          <br>
          If this individual opts for paid parking lot slots instead, then each year they
          have $(1600 - 165) = $1435 to themselves. 
          <br>
          This is a serious problem, and the scenario (where we temporarily ignored bills, 
          and other medical or personal expenses) is unrealistic. However, this is the reality
          for many low-income New York residents. For many of them, having to pay 3 consecutive
          parking tickets may cause them to fail to pay their rent. Which risks their chances
          of eviction. I would show the data on those who are directly affected, but such data 
          does not exist/ or is not available for me to use.
